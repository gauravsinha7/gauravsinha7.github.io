I graduated in 2018 in Computer Engineering from Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, India. Post  graduation, I joined Samsung R&D India- Bangalore, where I am currently working as Senior Software Engineer in Mobile Communication Division. My research areas include Next Generation Mobile Networks, AI in wireless, Cross-Layer Optimizations, Applied Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am also an IEEE member.

My interest in the fields of Deep Learning and Computational Linguistics has been a prolonged affair. My curiosity grew manifold with the advent of voice assistants and dialogue systems. To corroborate my theoretical grasp, I have done few research projects lying at the intersection of deep learning and linguistics. Currently I am in pursuit of combining deep learning with linguistics, doing more context-aware modeling, adding knowledge and feedback from humans, and paying more attention to interpretability and reasoning. I have started gaining knowledge of Vision work in order to understand Deep Learning in broader perspective.
